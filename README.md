Description: A website made based on a Figma prototype
Peer Reviewer: Alexander Soria
Review Notes: The site has 4 pages. While the other 3 are done well, I believe the index page could have been edited a bit to make it less cluttered. Viewing it at a normal resolution is difficult with the low font size. The page utilizes the knowledge we have learned so far very well, overall a good job.
