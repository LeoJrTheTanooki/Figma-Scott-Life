          <p>
            It's certainly been some time since I've updated here, hasn't it?
            Quite frankly I was in a really bad spot for a good couple of
            months... my girlfriend disappeared on me (literally, she shined
            brightly and then vanished in front of me), I got locked out of her
            apartment, and worst of all her cat ran away, so you can guess what
            all that combined can do to a guy's psyche. Not to mention all that
            fighting evil exes thing for her love was for nothing... or so I
            thought, but I'll get to that soon, right now I want to focus what I
            had gotten up to during that time.
          </p>

          <p>
            I had been doing... nothing at all throughout that period except
            grieving through self destructive ways. Eventually my gay friend who
            built this website for me suggested that I go out again to try and
            get over my disappeared girlfriend, and the first girl I see when he
            suggested that... was Knives, the highschooler that I dated last
            year to get over my previous ex, who had turned 18 recently.
            Considering my mindset by then, and the fact that she was 18 now,
            you can kinda guess how well I handled the conversation with her
            during that time (very horribly). We're still friends and found some
            closure though so I suppose it wasn't so bad. And then I ran into
            Envy…
          </p>

          <p>
            Her own blog was the reason I started this website in the first
            place, what with Knives constantly checking hers, I had to have my
            own to seem cool with her (thanks again Wallace). I was told by
            another friend to insult someone to bring them down, and of course
            my jackass brain picked Envy “Famous and Adored Singer” Adams in
            person… in front of a crowd no less… We met up somewhere else a bit
            later and had a more civil discussion and some closure as well, so
            there's no more beef between us anymore. Ramona's cat also came
            back, and believe me I took care of him as best as I could the
            second he did.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ultimately I went on a wilderness sabbatical in Northern Ontario to
            think about some junk and met up with Kim, the drummer of our band
            who moved away… and an ex of mine. We went on the sabbatical
            together and I uh... kissed her... (look I was really desperate,
            okay) and though she initially did it back, she pushed me away out
            of rejection and confronted me of my memories back in high school as
            I fought my Negative counterpart. So you know how I talked about my
            time in high school a while back? Fighting a school and saying
            goodbye to Kim the first time around? Yeah turns out I remembered
            all that wrong and now I feel horrible, though it was necessary to
            remember everything to prevent myself form making those dumb
            mistakes again. I also relented to the Nega-Scott and he became a
            part of me once again. Turns out he was the manifestation of me
            running from my mistakes and our reunion led to my memories coming
            back, warts and all.
          </p>

          <p>
            Long story short, I went back to Toronto, confronted Gideon Graves,
            he monologues about calling the evil exes through craigslist, we
            fought for a bit, I got killed and revived thanks to an extra life I
            had, Ramona came out of my chest and we fought Gideon together. Oh I
            also went into Ramona's mind through her subspace bag because Gideon
            was messing with her head through there and we finally finished him
            off. If he respawns I hope he goes to jail because this guy
            literally kidnapped and froze six of his exes with Ramona being the
            last one he wanted, not exactly someone you want roaming around the
            streets. Anyhow we're all doing a lot better now.
          </p>

          <p>
            I should mention that Ramona left to her dad's and also went on a
            sabbatical retreat when she disappeared on me, intending on
            improving herself, but she kinda just stayed inside all day anyways,
            like how I did when she left. Man looking back at this website is
            already filling me with so much regret, but then again I suppose
            that's what growth is. I'm still unsure if we'll continue this
            relationship, but I feel like there's a good chance we will. And if
            we do, I'll avoid making the same mistakes with Ramona this time
            around. We both screwed up, but that doesn't mean we can't grow.
            Anyways I still have to figure some of my own junk out for real this
            time. For myself this time, not just for Ramona.
